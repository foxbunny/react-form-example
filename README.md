# React form handling

This repository demonstrates a react form handling technique that takes full 
advantage of native APIs without using any controlled components or refs.

## Running the example

This example uses `esbuild`. To build the example, run:

```shell
npm run build
```

Then open `public/index.html` in your browser. No development server is 
required.
